## Client-Server Architecture:

### What is client-server Model?

Client server model is a architecture where client `(browser)` request and server process and send response back to the client.

### How does http `request` and `response` cycle works?

**Browser render**: Browser Render the data and show to the user or client.

## What happens when visit website:

1. **DNS Lockup**: Browser find the `IP address ` of `Domain` _example_ -> `google.com`

2. **Connection Establish**: Build connection between server and client through `TCP/IP` `(Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)`

3. **Request Send**: Browser send http request for the data .

4. **Response Receive**: Server send the required data to the browser.

5. **Website Render**: Browser render the data and display.

## Static `vs` Dynamic Website:

1. The content will be same all the users in static, Data will be different as per the user input.

2. There will be no backend , but in Dynamic website -> backend and database is required.

## What is web-hosting and how it works:

- The meaning of web-hosting is to store the all the files related to your website `(html, css, js and images)` to a server , which will be accessible through `Internet`.

**Works**:

**Files Upload to the server**:

**Register a domain name for the website which will be connected to your server `IP address`.**

**When someone type the `Domain` server send the required files and render in browser .**
