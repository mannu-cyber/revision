## How the internet works:

### 1. History of web (web 1.0 - 3.0)

### _Web 1.0 1990s_

1. In the starting face of websites.
2. User can only read .
3. No interaction was there.

   _example_ ->
   They were static websites, informative pages ,like digital version of newspaper.

### _Web 2.0 2000s_

When web 2.0 came into existence , website were become `Dynamic`, `Interactive` , were users can `like`, `share`, and `comment`

_example_ -> `Facebook`, `Youtube`, `Instagram` and `Blogs`, Users now can `create` content and `share` it .

### _Web 3.0 Present and the Future_

Web 3.0 is going to be game-changer with the `AI` and `Blockchain`

Users will have control on their own data.

It is going to finish the game of centralized servers dependency.

### 2. How computer communicate with each other.

When you open any website `(www.google.com)` your computer talk with server `(another computer)`

This communication go on in the `HTTP/ HTTPS` protocol . This language only understand by the computers only .

_example_ -> When we human talk with any one in `hindi , english` in the same way computer talk with `server (another computer)` via `HTTP/HTTPS` protocol.

### 3. How computer send data all over the world.

Data divide into small peaces called `packet`.

This packed goes from one computer to another computer via `switches` and `routers` in the computers.

Every `packet` contain sender `IP address` and receiver `IP address`

_example_ -> As we send letter, the data written in the letter `( packet)` it goes through postOffice `(routers and switches)`

### 4. What is Domain Name, IP & MAC Addresses and Routing.

**Domain Name**

This is Human readable name.

_example_ `www.google.com`

**IP (Internet Protocol) Address**

This is the unique number of every devices. It justify where to send the data .

_example_ 192.168.1.1

**MAC (Media Access Control Address) Address**

This is the hardware address, which is belongs to your network card. It only work on local network.

**Routing**

When data goes from one network to another network knows as `routing`.

Routers decide which the efficient way to way to send data.

_example_

just Assume you are sending parcel .

Domain Name: google name

IP Address: google server ip address

Router:Delivery Boy of courier which decide efficient path to deliver the parcel

MAC Address:Exact address of your room inside you home.

_example_-> room number.

### 5. How ISP and DNS work together to deliver data.

**ISP (internet service provider)**

This is the company who provide the internet services.

_example_ -> Jio, Airtel, BSNL

**DNS ( Domain Name System)**

It works like a phone-book. When we hit `www.google.com` then DNS turns these name into ip address.

_example_ -> as we know the name `google` but we don't know the `IP address`, DNS provide the exact `IP address`

**Complete Example**

when we open youtube `(www.youtube.com)` .

Our computer ask with `DNS` bro please give me the `IP address`.

Then `DNS` replied `216.58.214.206`.

Then your computer read this address and talk with `youtube` server.


Then `server` send the data into `packet` form (videos )
